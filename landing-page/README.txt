// Tipsease Prompt
Pitch: Service workers need a way to collect tips directly, rather than through their employers. This app will allow payment processing directly to service workers as a tip.

MVP: Service Employee can login and create, read and update a profile. Regular User can login and select a service employee and give them a tip.

Stretch: Implement a payment feature that actually allows money exchange with a service like, paypal or stripe or venmo.
